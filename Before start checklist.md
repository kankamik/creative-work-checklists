# Before start checklist 

*When something new is starting, it’s a good place to create a common basis for the work.*

+ [ ] Do we know all the stakeholders?
+ [ ] Do we know stakeholders that really matter?
+ [ ] Does everyone have a common understanding about quality?
+ [ ] Have we defined our level of good and great quality standards?
+ [ ] Have you sit down with team and stakeholders and defined playbook and/or best practices what, why and how things are treated, created and validated? *(example “First we create basis of digital style guide and everyone obeys rules defined there”, “Killer features will be enhanced from good to create before launch”, “We don’t do assumptions, we test our solutions” etc.)*
+ [ ] We have a place where all our important documentations are easily accessible?
+ [ ] We have defined what is important and why? *(example “We go extra mile for accessibility and performance")* 
+ [ ] If available, do we know where we get data when needed?
+ [ ] Do we know the target groups we validate our creative work?
+ [ ] Have we agreed on a date for a kickoff where we lay out the basis for all of what we do?
