*How communications are approached and treated.*

+ [ ] Have we defined and approved that creative workers attend to all meetings related to the digital products and services?
+ [ ] Have we communicated to stakeholders about when to contact straight to creative workers and when project managers?
+ [ ] Does the stakeholders know all relevant creative people?
+ [ ] Have we collected contact information about all stakeholders to a commonly accessible place?
+ [ ] Do we have our digital product or service running or shown in a environment that easily accessible for stakeholders?
+ [ ] Do we have routine to keep all relevant people informed about the things we do?
