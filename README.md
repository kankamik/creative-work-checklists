# Creative works checklists
This repository contains checklists to help creative people prioritize and organize actions and thinking when dealing with agile environments.

It's just initial list's and I warmly welcome you to collaborate on them or just go ahead and create your own ones.

I'm still in the middle of creating an example about the playbook and best practices guide but they are coming too.
